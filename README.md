The interpretation of neural networks and their predictions is a significant challenge. Neural networks are considered as “black boxes”. Hence, there is a real need to make neural networks more interpretable, and this is particularly true in the medical field (Biological interpretation of deep neural networks learned from transcriptomic data).
    * Biological interpretation of deep neural networks learned from transcriptomic data.
    * Development of a new model called Deep GONet.
    * Ability to deep-dive into research papers, down to a technical depth required to translate them into code using both existing toolkits and self-developed code.
